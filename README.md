///How to run it

Download node v11.11.0
Replace App.js and index.css with my files
Command line npm start in the same directory as the files

p.s as i remember I have also installed npm command, make sure to add the path in the environmental variables since its command line




p.s I wanted to add the button as a font awesome icon, but for some reasons It didnt recognize the module when i tried to import it even though I have installed it...

#thankyou
